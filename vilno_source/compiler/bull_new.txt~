can timing of a/b b/a conversion affect reverse age order ?
u want to know when dset was created , not when it was converted.

SOME QUIRKS between C++ bull2.cpp and the Python code base :
BRANDNEW dset creation : any previous status info for that datref becomes irrelevant, so overwrite
messy AB/BA convert (where .datref!=.twin_of) : for Python code, just treat as
  brandnew dset creation
Possible status of each datref :
01: old dset, converted to vdt (or asc)
02: brandnew dset made, as vdt (or as asc)
03: brandnew dset made, as vdt (or as asc) , and then 
      converted to asc (or vdt)

Status before brandnew-dset-creation no longer matters,
2 or more AB/BA converts is weird and bad
AB/BA convert in wrong direction is weird and bad , an example
brandnew dset made (as vdt) , and then convert from asc to vdt = really bad

current AB/BA code allows for creating a twin file with different filename or directory, 
but Python app only interested in twin files with same filename (only suffix is different)

more local vars :

scenarios 
in or not-in brandnew_dset_age
incoming bstatus = "vdt" "asc" "a+v" "vdt<-old" "asc<-old" 

this is brandnew creation  or   clean-ABBA
this is making an "asc" or "vdt"
