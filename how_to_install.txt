Read this Readme file before you install the software

To install Vilno Data Transformation software, run install.sh. However,
before you do that, you should read the following:
The default installation makes the following assumptions about WHERE you 
install, and that default choice should be acceptable for any variant of Linux.
The Vilno Data Transformation application (VDT app), including source code, is 
contained in a directory called vilno_etc. vilno_etc contains not only files
(such as install.sh and how_to_install.txt) but also it's own sub-directories
(in particular vilno_etc/vilno_source, which contains the VDT source code, 
written in C++). When downloading the VDT app, the entire contents should be 
deposited in 
/usr/local/src/vilno_etc

If you placed the VDT materials in another directory, you will need to move
them to /usr/local/src/vilno_etc (before you can run install.sh).

If you have moved the VDT materials to the proper location, then the 
directory /usr/local/src/vilno_etc will contain the files how_to_install.txt and
install.sh (along with several other files) and, in addition, the directory
 /usr/local/src/vilno_etc will contain the sub-directory vilno_source ( this 
subdirectory contains a great deal of C++ source code files).

During the default installation of VDT, using install.sh, contents are placed in 
these locations:
/tmp , /usr/local/src/vilno_etc, /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib

Assuming you downloaded the VDT materials to the proper location, open up a 
Linux terminal and do the following:

cd /usr/local/src/vilno_etc
sudo ./install.sh

(I am assuming you already have GCC (C++ compiler) already installed. And I 
am assuming that GCC can be called with the reference "c++". The code in 
install.sh makes that assumption.)

Now, having run install.sh, Vilno Data Transformation is now installed.

Now after you have installed the software, there are a couple of things to 
check:

Next, you should run a test program to verify that Vilno Data Transformation
has been installed properly. To make that quick and easy, I have provided an 
easy test program, called     vdt_test.src

Copy that file over to the directory /tmp , activate the bash shell terminal 
(the line by line console that is well known to Linux users), go to the 
directory where you copied the test program.

Then run this command:

vilno vdt_test.src

If VDT is properly installed, then a test printout will be generated,
(the filename is vdt_test_out.prt ). Take a look at it.

It produces a printout, the file vdt_test_out.prt, which contains a printout
of a dataset with only 6 rows, and a dataset with only 1 row containing 
simple summary statistics. Look at this printout to verify that Vilno Data 
Transformation has been installed without error.

########################################################################

Next, I mention a couple of configuration details that might complicate the 
install:

First, the $PATH environment variable (an option that is well known to 
experienced users of Linux or Unix). The $PATH variable is probably not an issue
because $PATH probably already includes /usr/local/bin .
Verify that the $PATH variable includes:  /usr/local/bin
If $PATH does not yet include that path, it must be added. This is a Linux/Unix
administration detail. Most likely, $PATH already includes this path, in which 
case, you are all set regarding that detail.
(Type $PATH at the terminal to verify that /usr/local/bin is one of the paths
in $PATH).
/usr/local/bin is where any binary executables were placed when VDT was 
installed in the default manner.


Next, file permissions for the file install.sh . Again, this is likely not an
issue because install.sh should already have the proper file permissions. This 
is a technical issue that experienced users of Linux or Unix should be familiar
with: each file has permissions for three actions: read, write, and execute. 
If for some reason, the file install.sh does not have the correct Unix file
permissions, you can try this:
sudo chmod +x install.sh
By executing the above command, the file will have, in addition to read/write
permissions, execute permissions.


Next, if you're using Ubuntu Linux, I assume you know what "sudo" means. You run
any command with full root permissions by typing sudo before typing the command
itself.
For example, instead of 
./install.sh
you type the command
sudo ./install.sh
If you are using a version of Linux other than Ubuntu, just login as root when
installing VDT.

Another detail:
When running the command:
sudo ./install.sh
you are essentially executing the file install.sh (with root permission).
So why do you have to do ./install.sh instead of just install.sh ?
While annoying, that is because $PATH often does NOT include the 
current working directory.



[ By the way, if you are curious, you may have noticed that you were not 
required to copy over any 
data files, only that one test program file. Most programs read in existing 
input data files, process and transform the data and write out the results to
new output data files. The first data-processing paragraph in the test program
reads in NO input data files, generates multiple rows with artificial data (via
a loop), and writes the generated rows to a new output data file. Hence you may
run the test program with no input data files.]
